# mimic.el

This is a proof of concept Emacs package that does something evil the
moment it is installed and modifies itself such that if you inspect
the code after installation, it looks innocent.

This is intended as a warning to be careful installing Emacs packages.

Build mimic.el by running make.

Please read the code before trying it out.
